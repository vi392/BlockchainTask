      A<strong>blockchain</strong> is a<mark> distributed ledger</mark> with
      growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via
      cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block<del>
        contains</del
      >
      a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
      represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the
      previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data
      structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
      Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they
      are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
      without altering all subsequent blocks.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    
    <p>
      Cryptographer <mark>David Chaum</mark> first proposed a blockchain-like
      protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established,
      Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work
      on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by
      Stuart Haber and <mark>W. Scott Stornetta.</mark><sup>[4][11]</sup> They
      wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be
      tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated
      Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing
      several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup

      >
      Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been
      published in <mark><i>The New York Times</i></mark> every week since
      1995.<sup>[13] </sup>

    <h3>Structure and design</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A blockchain is a <mark>decentralized, distributed, </mark>and often public, <mark> digital
      ledger </mark>consisting of records called blocks that are used to record
      transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
      altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent
      blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit
      transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A blockchain
      database is managed autonomously using a <mark>peer-to-peer</mark> network and a
      distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
      collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design
      facilitates robust workflow where.
